I was with him that day, and we both looked at each other wondering—what exactly is BNI? Out of curiosity, we decided to attend online. Abhilash went in, but after the meeting, we both felt—maybe this is not our cup of tea. Time passed, we grew in our own way, and BNI also grew in its own way. But as they say—God always has a plan. Years later, our close friend Mr. Sameer reintroduced us to BNI. He insisted I attend, and though I was hesitant at first, I finally joined an online meeting of the Monarch chapter. That meeting gave me a small spark. After some thinking—and a lot of Sameer’s push—I finally decided to join. And that’s how Paithrika Homes became part of BNI. Looking back, I can say it was one of the best decisions I’ve made. BNI helped me connect with amazing professionals in Trivandrum, attend trainings that re-energized me, and regain the enthusiasm I once had. Now, waking up early for a 7:30 AM meeting is no longer a task—it’s something I eagerly look forward to every week. For me, BNI is not just a network—it’s a family. I am truly grateful to be a part of it. Thank you.",

For the past month, I had been seeing Sreeraman Mooss’ status updates about his journey with the BNI Glorious chapter in Malappuram. I kept wondering—Will I ever be able to join? Who would even introduce me? And then came that unexpected message from Sameer Sir, as if the universe itself had answered my thoughts. As Paulo Coelho said, “When you truly want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.” Sameer Sir opened the door. Then Sajna Ma’am trusted me enough to take treatment from Aihika Ayurveda and even referred two of her friends, who also became part of our healing journey. And now, for the past five days, I’ve had the honor of treating Mrs. Radhika Suresh Gopi. What more could I ask for? And then came Uma Ma’am, whose trust means the world—especially as she is the proud daughter of a renowned Ayurveda Acharya, someone with deep knowledge of medicine and healing. I’m immensely grateful. Thank you, Sameer Sir, for introducing me to this whole new world and for reminding me of the mission and purpose behind Aihika Ayurveda—my dream, my child. Thank you, Sajna Ma’am, for believing in us and for your generous referrals. And thank you, Uma Ma’am, for choosing us with confidence.",
